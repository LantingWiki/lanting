My third annual developer survey suggests that developer support for Valve's 30% share just hit an all time low; this sentiment is consistent regardless of developer size, wealth, and geographic location.

And with all that out of the way, it's time for our first challenge! Let's start with an easy one.

1. Tell people you even have a store
It stands to reason that if you want people to come to your store and buy things, you should probably mention somewhere besides press releases that you even have a store, right?

Here's my test:

Google the store's name and visit the first link
Try to find a store that sells video games
(I'm using a VPN and a browser in incognito mode so that cookies and google personalization don't monkey with my search results).
