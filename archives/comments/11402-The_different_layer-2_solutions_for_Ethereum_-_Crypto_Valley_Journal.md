State channels
Further, only limited smart contract functionality is available. Projects working on State channel include Celer and Raiden Network.

Plasma (Child chains)
Like state channels, plasma solutions do not fully support smart contracts and are suitable only for transactions and swaps. Projects that use plasma layers include Polygon and OMG Network.

Sidechains
xDai and Polygon are two examples for Ethereum sidechains.

Optimistic Rollups
Examples of rollups are Optimism and Arbitrum

Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups
Currently, there is no generalised EVM-compatible zk rollup based solution, and only specific solutions for transfer or exchanges are available. Loopring is a decentralised exchange working on zk rollups with transaction costs of less than a cent.

Validium
StarkWare’s StarkEx is a validium-based solution. StarkEx is integrated with the derivatives exchange, dYdX, and the NFT platform, ImmutableX.
