So basically Deno has its own bundler that lets you not have a local build step and it gets bundled dynamically per-route as requested by users, right? This is very different from industry standards and possibly has many new concerns from devs, none of which are addressed in the article since it's treating the system as a perfect solution, which makes sense since it's a marketing page ("content marketing"). If it was a 3rd party article, I'd be interested in things like:

It's like you combined the warmup phase of the JVM with the compilation phase, except you still have to wait for the JIT, too. I better not hear anyone complain about JVM warmup times again. :p

Man the things that pass for innovation in the node-adjacent space continues to blow my mind. It feels like hte horrors of /r/programmerhumor meets generic internet hype-beast cycles.
