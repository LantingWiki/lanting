Think about that for a second. Passing the driving test wasn’t a guarantee. And even with a driver’s license, becoming a Grab driver wasn’t guaranteed either, because Grab also has tests and requirements. But they gambled their savings to buy a car and jury-rig it, hoping that they would pass both tests. Can you imagine how scary this must have been for them?

This astonishing, sweet, shy woman came to our offsite, and Anthony was trying to thank her in front of everyone, but no, she kept thanking him over and over for giving her a chance at being helpful to others and earning an income, and she wouldn’t stop, so of course his tears started flowing, and shit, I’m crying, because it’s so backwards that she should want to thank us when in fact we owe her so much for putting up with all this just to drive on our platform. She got dealt just about the worst cards life can give you, and her spirit and sweetness were just overpowering, and it was too much.

Wow I need a quick break. Onions. I’ll be back.
