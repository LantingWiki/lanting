So let's begin. Here's how you can build a successful business that competes directly with Steam:

Don't!

you can't just build a better mousetrap, because you'll be absolutely murdered by Steam's impenetrable network effects

Even if every aspect of your service is better than Steam's in every possible way, you're still up against the massive inertia of everybody already having huge libraries full of games on Steam. Their credit cards are registered on Steam, their friends all play on Steam, and most importantly, all the developers, and therefore all the games, are on Steam.

Furthermore, despite all of the constant (and justified!) complaints everyone has about Steam's services, you're kidding yourself if you think you, as a startup, are going to do a better job on every single one. For one, there's no way in hell you're going to be able to manage the amount of traffic and server load they do. Second, you don't have the institutional memory and processes built up over years and years to deal with all the crazy edge cases, hacking, and general abuse of your system.

So your path to not fail before you even start looks something like this:

Straight up bribe developers to post their games
Posting games must be zero-friction
Straight up bribe players to use your system
Playing/buying games must be zero-friction
You have to do all four of these things, and nail every single one, just to begin. Do that and your chances of success rise from a flat 0% to an impressive ~1%, rounded up.

Steam is Steam and has all the games and all the players and all the money.
GOG has retro games, and retro gamers, and also CDProjekt Red.
Amazon has Twitch and Amazon Prime and Jeff Bezos, who cannot be killed until the six horcruxes scattered across the galaxy are gathered and cast into the fires of Mount Doom.
Blizzard has all the AAA Blizzard games and all the money.
Origin has all the AAA EA games and all the money.
TenCent has one Metric China of customers, a special relationship with their government, and all the money.
Humble is at least as good as you at most things and already has a bunch of people locked into a fancy little subscription service and they give more money to charity than you.
Itch has the best tools and lowest overhead, and also by the way the devotion of all the scrappy small-time indies you thought were free for the taking.
Good luck out there, and mind the sharks.
