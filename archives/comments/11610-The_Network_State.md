### Chapter1 Quickstart

`不能建新国家, 这本身是不合理的. 譬如公司, 当然可以开新公司`

### Chapter2 History as Trajectory

1. The power of history and why it matters (esp. for startup society & network state)
2. History can be empirical and can be experimented
3. It used to get distorted, now comes Blockchain
4. Now Network / Blockchain has power beyond State. Let's talk about the 3 Leviatians, God, State, Network. The clash of Leviatians is the Zeitgeist
5. 

`有两种力量. Political Power和Technological Power. 其他的都是secondary, 是燃料. 就像石油. 金融正是如此`

It’s about community culture first, and technological innovation second. And while innovating on technology means forecasting the future, innovating on culture means probing the past.

`Laws of Physics vs. Law of Society`

That is, many thousands of people are engaged full time in “offense archaeology,” the excavation of the recent and distant past for some useful incident they can write up to further demoralize their political opposition. This is the scholarly version of going through someone’s old tweets. It’s weaponized history, history as opposition research. You simply can’t win an argument against such people on pure logic alone; you need facts, so you need history.

This history is used to defend ancient regulations; if you change them, people will die! As such, to legalize physical innovation you’ll need to become a counter-historian. Only when you understand the legitimating history of regulatory agencies better than their proponents do can you build a superior alternative: a new regulatory paradigm capable of addressing both the abuses of the American regulatory state and the abuses they claim to prevent.

History determines morality. E.g. Religion

Wherein most articles aren’t really about true-or-false, but good-and-bad. Try it yourself. Just by glancing at a headline from any establishment outlet

There’s only room for so many moral lessons in one society, because a brain’s capacity for moral computation is limited. So you get a totally different society if 99% of people allocate their limited moral memory to principles like “hard work good, meritocracy good, envy bad, charity good” than if 99% of people have internalized nostrums like “socialism good, civility bad, law enforcement bad, looting good.”

History is the true value of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is worth hundreds of billions of dollars because it’s a cryptographically verifiable history of who holds what BTC.

Because history textbooks are written by the winners. They are authored, subtly or not, to tell a story of great triumph by the ruling establishment over its past enemies. The only history most people in the US know is 1776, 1865, 1945, and 1965 - a potted history of revolutions, world wars, and activist movements that lead ineluctably to the sunny uplands of greater political equality.12 It’s very similar to the history the Soviets taught their children, where all of the past was interpreted through the lens of class struggle. And even any successful startup tells a founding story that sands off the rough edges.

if you look carefully the ruling class that authors that treatment typically justifies itself as the champion of those victims. This is why one of the first acts of any conquering regime is to rewrite the textbooks (click those links), to tell you who’s in charge.

History determines your hiring policy -> Libral white is less legit. But this is rather weak argument. He is not moral doesn't make his statements so

History is how you debug our broken society. 

So: the scale is huge, the timeframe is long, and the measurements aren’t just noisy but intentionally corrupted.

We can encode all of this into a phrase: history is a cryptic epic of twisting trajectories.

`因为我们都做实验, 找规律. 所以修改历史能改变人们的行为, 改变一起. 所以1984 he who controls the past controls the future`

Only a civilization with a strong capacity for accurate microhistory could ever make it to the moon.

`真的可以变成深刻的民众和民众之间的斗争. 抗疫. 事先难以预想得到`

Second, and relatedly, science progresses by improved instrumentation, by better recordkeeping. Star charts enabled celestial navigation. Johann Balmer’s documentation of the exact spacing of hydrogen’s emission spectra led to quantum mechanics. Gregor Mendel’s careful counting of pea plants led to modern genetics. 

To a significant extent, what we know about history is what we’ve recovered from what people wrote down -> `also the case but less distorted for science`

Fourth, today, we have digital documentation on an unprecedented scale. We have billions of people using social media each day for almost a decade now. We also have billions of phones taking daily photographs and videos. We have countless data feeds of instruments. And we have massive hard drives to store it all. So, if reckoned on the basis of raw bytes, we likely record more information in a day than all of humanity recorded up to the year 1900. It is by far the most comprehensive log of human activity we’ve ever had.

We can now see the continuum23 between macrohistory and microhistory. We are collecting the kinds of precise, quantitative, microhistorical measurements that typically led to the emergence of a new science…but at the scale of billions of people, and going into our second decade.

After all, what’s another word for data storage in a computer? Memory. Memory, as in the sense of human memory, and as in the sense of history.

That memory is commercially valuable. A technologist who neglects history ensures their users will get exploited. Proof? Consider reputation systems. Any scaled marketplace has them. The history of an Uber driver or rider’s on-platform behavior partially predicts their future behavior. Without years of star ratings, without memories of past actions of millions of people, these platforms would be wrecked by fraud. Macrohistory makes money.

This is just one example. There are huge short and long-term incentives to record all this data, all this microhistory and macrohistory. And future historians24 will study our digital log to understand what we were like as a civilization.

In the top-down view, history is written by the winners. It is about political power triumphing over technological truth.

Coming from a different vantage point, Rene Girard would call this a “founding murder.” Once you see this technique, you see it everywhere. Somewhat toned-down versions of the atrocity story are the go-to technique used to justify expansions of political power.

If we don’t force people to take off their shoes at the airport, people will die!
If we don’t stop people from voluntarily taking experimental curative drugs, people will die!
If we don’t set up a disinformation office to stop people from making hostile comments online, people will die!

Stereotypically, the people of God offer prayers and refer to Quran or Bible; the people of the State say “there oughta be a law!”; and the people of the Network write some code.

The gray tribe is the easiest to analyze. It is fair to say that they are primarily people of the Network Leviathan. These technological progressives are not just atheists, they are also astatists, as they do not typically believe in either God or the State.

So now we have an umbrella term: doctrine. God-worshippers have religions (religious doctrines), State-loyalists have political parties (with political doctrines), and Network-centrists have social networks or cryptocurrencies (with tightly enforced content moderation or crypto tribalism respectively, which are network doctrines). Each doctrine has a Leviathan, a most powerful force.

because it’s actually crucial to note that wokes do not worship God; instead, one faction of wokes worships the State and the other is, less consciously, people of the Network -> `wokes are members of State or Network`

For the left-authoritarians among the blues, their primary Leviathan is the State, which is very real and can do violence against its/their enemies, as opposed to what they think of as an imaginary God. This is why State-worshippers mock the concept of “thoughts and prayers” in favor of “passing a law.” The State exists, after all, and can organize people to apply coercive force. But God’s vehicle, the church, no longer has enough belief behind it (in the West at least) to do the same.

`Do do what law says not = Do defy the Sharia`

the Gov-fearing man is like the God-fearing man - reliably surging behind the current thing.

There are incipient signs of pushback here, though, at places like Netflix and even Google, where the very wokest are being terminated.

The key concept is that much of America’s control circuitry has evolved to live outside the formal state
As with the communists who endlessly burbled about their “democratic people’s republics” while eschewing elections, the left-authoritarians don’t actually subject their control of key institutions to a vote.54

Later we will call it NYT/USD, to emphasize their source of truth and digital economy relative to BTC/web3 and CCP/RMB.
It’s important to understand that the power of the left-authoritarians comes from getting the officials of the centralized American State and (more recently) the executives of the centralized Big Tech Network to crush their enemies.

The Soviets had a state-controlled press, but America now had a press-controlled state. Much easier to pin it all on a single Nixon, or even a Stalin for that matter, than a decentralized mass of nameless left-authoritarians. the left-authoritarians have shifted their targets to the new authorities: the CEOs of tech companies in particular. They realize on some level that (a) Network > State in many contexts and furthermore that (b) the Network-aided global ascent of tech founders and populist leaders could reduce their control over the State, so they have chosen to (c) strike first by gaining control of those tech companies that have achieved state-like scale.

`有需求`

a key realization for a tech founder should be that a significant fraction of people want moral progress.
But the forgotten American “communistic societies” of the 1800s were generally good, because only those who wanted to be there remained. Anyone who didn’t like it could leave. That’s why the reopening of the frontier is so important: it gives space to morally innovate without affecting those who don’t consent to the experiment.

Terrorist groups like ISIS which operate across borders and have seized territory at times aren’t considered states because they lack diplomatic recognition (due to their heinous crimes!). That said, the Soviet Communists were the ISIS of their day, and they just had to hold out 16 years for FDR to recognize them, so with enough persistence this designation can change.

Social rather than geographic proximity is the core organizing principle
